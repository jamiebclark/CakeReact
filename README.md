# CakeReact
Plugin to make CakePHP 2.X work with ReactJS.

This plugin is where I can store my progress as I develop more functionality learning React and having it integrate with my existing CakePHP 2.X sites.

Right now the CakePHP aspect is dependent on the ApiComponent found in the [FormData Plugin](https://github.com/jamiebclark/FormData).
